# Challenge 26 >> Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that traverses the array multiple times as it slowly builds out the sorting sequence. The traversal keeps track of the minimum value and places it in the front of the array which should be incrementally sorted.

# Challenge 27 >> Merge Sort

Merge sort is a “divide and conquer” algorithm wherein we first divide the problem into subproblems. When the solutions for the subproblems are ready, we combine them together to get the final solution to the problem

# Challenge 28 >> Quick Sort

Quicksort is a sorting algorithm, which is leveraging the divide-and-conquer principle. It has an average O(n log n) complexity and it’s one of the most used sorting algorithms, especially for big data volumes
